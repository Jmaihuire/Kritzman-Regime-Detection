Regime Detection  

This project will require data manipulation, machine learning, and writing in Python. In order for me to get a sense how much of these skills your team has I am going to give both NYU teams a skills test. 

In the attached paper you will find some research on regimes and regime detection. Please read the paper for your understanding and then using Python write a function for detecting regimes. You will find the required data in the attached Excel file. If youâ€™re stuck on how to write the code there is some MATLAB code at the end of the paper which can help. Please attempt to have this returned to me by Monday, September 9th at the latest. 

After you have completed writing your code, please send it to me and answer the following questions.
1.       What are the assumptions behind the model?
2.       What happens if they are not true?
3.       What potential weaknesses and limitations can you identify in this approach?
